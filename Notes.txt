Step 1: Read problem
  - Problem is very similar to the prisoner and light switch problem.
  - Minotaur has n guests (threads)
  - One guest can enter the labyrinth  at a time
  - Starts with cake at the end
  - Can eat the cake if there is cake, can ask for a new cake, can eat the new cake
    can leave the new cake
  - Has to be able to tell the minotaur that everyone has gone

Step 2: Devise ideas and potential solutions
  - Each guest is a thread
  - The labyrinth is a critical section
  - The cake is a shared / atomic variable that needs to be accessed
  - The guests are stored in some data structure and chosen to enter the
    labyrinth at random
  - One thread is the leader / counter
    - If they find no cake in the labyrinth then that means someone else has
      gone through. They add 1 to the amount of people who went and order new cake.
    - If they find cake that means it has not been someone's first time in the
      labyrinth and does nothing
  - Every other thread
    - They can only eat the cake if it is their first time through
  - The selected counter is the only one that can order a new cake

Step 3: Write program to solve problem
Step 4: Test
